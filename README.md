# modules
Various modules that I use for several projects.

Most Have a test routine that allows them to be tested by running the file direct.

This also helps in seeing how to use them.

Additional Modules needed:

for tuyacloud.py     pip3 install tinytuya

For tuyaCloud.py you need a file  /home/pi/.tuyaJson/tinytuya.json

Containing:

```
{
    "apiKey": "<your api key",
    "apiSecret": ",<you secret>",
    "apiRegion": "eu",
    "apiDeviceID": "<a device ID>"
}
```
