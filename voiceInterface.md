# Proposal by ChatGPT for Testing Voice to MQTT Integration with Rhasspy

1. Install Rhasspy on your Raspberry Pi 4. You can follow the installation instructions on the Rhasspy website.

2. Set up a Rhasspy profile and configure it to use the MQTT protocol for communication. In the Rhasspy web interface, go to Settings > Profile and select your profile. Then, go to the MQTT tab and enter the information for your MQTT broker, including the IP address or hostname of your Raspberry Pi 4 and the MQTT port (default is 1883). Save your changes.

3. Create an MQTT topic for Rhasspy to publish voice command messages to. For example, you can create a topic called "rhasspy/commands".

4. In the Rhasspy web interface, go to the Wake Word tab and select a wake word engine to use. Then, train the wake word engine to recognize your chosen wake word.

5. In the Rhasspy web interface, go to the Sentences tab and create a new sentence that Rhasspy should recognize as a voice command. For example, you can create a sentence that says "turn on the living room lights". Save your changes.

6. Test the voice recognition by saying the wake word followed by the voice command you created. For example, if your wake word is "Hey Rhasspy" and your voice command is "turn on the living room lights", say "Hey Rhasspy, turn on the living room lights". Rhasspy should recognize the wake word and voice command, and publish a message to the "rhasspy/commands" MQTT topic with the recognized text.

7. Verify that the message was published to the MQTT topic by using the Mosquitto command-line tool. You can subscribe to the "rhasspy/commands" topic using the following command: `mosquitto_sub -t rhasspy/commands`. This will show any messages published to the topic.

8. Integrate the MQTT message handling into your Python-based home heating control system, so that it can receive and act on voice commands sent by Rhasspy.

## The suggested Python to use with this by ChatGPT was this

    import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

    def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):
  
         print("Connected with result code "+str(rc))
      
         client.subscribe("mytopic")

    def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
      
         print(msg.topic+" "+str(msg.payload))

    client = mqtt.Client()
  
    client.on_connect = on_connect
  
    client.on_message = on_message
  
    client.connect("localhost", 1883, 60)
  
    client.loop_forever()
